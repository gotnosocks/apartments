# Chelsea pricing research backlog

## Floor representation

- [ ] **Gaussian process for the floor increment model** — user research idea,
  September 19, 2026. Explore correlated increments across listed-floor levels
  using a Gaussian-process prior in PyMC. Compare against the selected natural
  cubic spline on the same frozen source cohort. Evaluate joint floor contrasts,
  coefficient uncertainty, prior sensitivity, residuals and full-length sampling
  diagnostics/work. Record kernel and length-scale assumptions explicitly;
  evaluate increments versus a GP on floor-price levels as distinct choices.
  This is a research candidate, not a change to the selected main model.

- [ ] **Random walk for floor increments** — user research idea, September 19,
  2026. Let neighboring floor increments vary while encouraging each increment
  to stay near the previous one (equivalently, a joint neighbor-difference
  penalty links it to both neighbors in the interior). Explore a learned
  innovation scale and an explicit starting/anchoring prior in PyMC. Distinguish
  a random walk on increments from a random walk on the floor-price levels;
  compare both interpretations with the GP and selected spline using the same
  frozen cohort, joint contrasts, prior sensitivity and full-length diagnostics.

## Floor measurement

- [x] Audit why the selected model has only 56.8% floor coverage. The
  [complete census](../analysis/chelsea-floor-coverage-reassessment-2026-09-19.md)
  identifies omitted formats and reviews all six new-rule disagreements.
- [x] Broaden the initial label parser beyond one/two digits plus one letter.
  Audit numeric labels, wing prefixes, multi-letter suffixes and floor-only
  labels against own-advertisement evidence and building numbering. Keep
  advertised labels separate from physical height and preserve source conflicts.
  The published expanded source reaches 68.36% observation coverage; the
  selected fit still uses the narrow v1 policy until the matched refit passes.
  See the [source experiment](expanded-floor-source-experiment-2026-09-19.md).
- [x] Project the five confirmed reference-photo floor errors at 160 W22 through
  source-bound corrections, preserving their raw claims and separate numeric
  label evidence. Keep the 244 W16 `1RE` label/prose discrepancy explicit.
- [ ] Complete and assess the full matched spline refit on the expanded source,
  including residual/source reviews and the support-dependent prior change,
  before updating the selected main analysis.
- [ ] Improve explicitly scoped description-floor extraction using the three
  corroborating cases in the [expanded-source panel](../analysis/chelsea-expanded-floor-source-panel-2026-09-19.md):
  a `53RD FLOOR!` headline, `3rd floor of a walkup building`, and `this 11th floor`.
  A replay of each full description through `attribute-evidence-v6` still yields
  no advertised-floor claim. Preserve photo-reference and shared-amenity scope
  protections; the current label projection already recovers matching values.

## Floor–elevator interaction

- [ ] Reassess the interaction on the expanded source after its matched base fit
  passes. The [support audit](../analysis/chelsea-expanded-floor-elevator-support-2026-09-19.md)
  has walk-up data only on floors 1–6, with especially thin floor-5-to-6 support.
  Check lower-floor contrasts, unit-effect pooling and opposing elevator claims;
  do not treat high-rise walk-up extrapolation as supported by the data.
